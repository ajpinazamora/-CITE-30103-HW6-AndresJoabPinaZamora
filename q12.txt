Explanation of What Happened:
The expression a + b << 1 does not add a and b first.
In C, the bitwise left shift operator (<<) has higher precedence than the addition operator (+).
Therefore, the expression is evaluated as:
res = a + (b << 1);

Here’s what happens step by step:
b << 1 = 3 << 1 = 6
res = 5 + 6 = 11

The developer expected (a + b) * 2 = 16, but because of operator precedence, 
the shift happened first, giving the wrong result (11 instead of 16).

Two Corrections:

1. Using Parentheses (to control precedence):
res = a + (b << 1);   // 5 + (3 << 1) = 5 + (6) = 11 

2. Using Arithmetic Multiplication:
res = a + b * 2;    // 5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11

Correct Output:
res = 11
