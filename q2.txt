1. Preprocessing Stage:
   - The preprocessor handles all lines that begin with ‘#’, such as 
     #include and #define.
   - It replaces macros, inserts header files, and removes comments.
   - Example Error: “fatal error: myfile.h: No such file or directory”
     (when a header file cannot be found).

2. Compilation Stage:
   - The compiler checks syntax, data types, and converts the 
     preprocessed code into assembly code.
   - Example Error: “error: expected ‘;’ before ‘return’” 
     (missing semicolon or invalid syntax).

3. Assembly Stage:
   - The assembler translates the assembly code into object code 
     (machine language) and produces an object file (.o).
   - Example Error: “unknown instruction” (invalid inline assembly).

4. Linking Stage:
   - The linker combines all object files and external libraries 
     into a single executable file.
   - Example Error: “undefined reference to ‘sqrt’” 
     (when using a function not linked with the proper library).

5. Loading/Execution Stage:
   - The operating system loads the executable into memory and 
     begins running it starting from main().
   - Example Error: “Permission denied” or “No such file or directory”
     (if the executable cannot be run properly).
