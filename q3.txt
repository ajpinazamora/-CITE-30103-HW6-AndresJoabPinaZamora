If #include <stdio.h> is removed from a program that uses the printf function, the compiler no longer knows the definition of printf. Without this header, the compiler cannot verify the function’s prototype or return type.

During the compilation stage, the compiler will generate an error such as:

error: implicit declaration of function 'printf' is invalid in C99

or

error: ‘printf’ undeclared (first use in this function)

Because of this missing header, the compilation fails, and no executable file is created until the #include <stdio.h> line is restored.
