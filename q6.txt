1value 
Error: Identifiers cannot begin with a digit.
Fix: Rename to start with a letter or underscore.
int value1 = 10;

avg-rate
Error: The hyphen - is not allowed in identifiers; it’s treated as a subtraction operator.
Fix: Use an underscore _ or camel case instead.
float avg_rate = 12.5;

Class 
Error: Although uppercase names are allowed, Class conflicts with the C++ keyword class and should be avoided for portability and clarity.
Fix: Use a lowercase or descriptive name.
char grade = 'A'; or char class_grade = 'A';
